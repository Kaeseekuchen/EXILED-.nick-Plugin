# Installation
You will need **latest** [EXILED Version](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED/releases/latest) installed on your server.

Put your [`SimpleNick.dll`](https://github.com/Kaeseekuchen/SimpleNick/releases/latest) file in `EXILED/Plugins` path.
Once your plugin will load, it will create a file `EXILED/Configs/blockednick.yml`; This file will contain all users blocked from using the .nick command.
